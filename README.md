# Screen-Time-Analyzer-
This is my first project using python to be able to analyze data as well as visualize it 

This project was created with a sample data from a instagram user, using pandas, numpy and plotly I was able to analyze the user's screentime data as well as 
the relationship between phone usage and notifications from instagram.
